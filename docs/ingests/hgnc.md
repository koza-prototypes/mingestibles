### Gene Information

This ingest uses HGNC's "complete set" download file, which only contains associations between publications and genes that are denoted in some way in the publication. We have selected to use a consistent high level term for 'publication' (IAO:0000311) as it is heterogeneous mix of publication types being referenced.
